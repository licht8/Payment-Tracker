Just a simple calculator for calculating the repayments of a fixed monthly loan.

# Description:
Enter for example ./loan-calculator.sh 50 2500 300
where 50 is the expected number of months (you can use any number, the main thing is more than you need)
2500 is the amount to be paid
300 is how much you will pay off per month and it calculates how many months it takes
as soon as you have paid off the debt, it will stop and show the statistics.
